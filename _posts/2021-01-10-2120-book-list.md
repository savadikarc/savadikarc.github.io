As the world was in a lockdown, I was finally out of excuses. So here is a list of book I managed to read.

##### Fiction
- **A Tale of Two Cities** by Charles Dickens
  
  Perhaps the best novel I have read uptil now. No event is black or white, but always gray. Dickens portrays the events of the French Revolution, showing why it was necessary, as well as its unintended consequences.
- **A Christmas Carol** by Charles Dickens
  
  Just your normal, feel-good story.

##### Sci-Fi
- **Exhalation: Stories** by Ted Chiang
  
  A book which gives you many questions to ponder over, the mark of excellent sci-fi.
- **The Food of the Gods** by H.G. Wells

  What would happen if organisms never stopped growing? The story portrays arguments from both sides, normal humans and giants. Who is right? The giants who had no control over what they became, or the normal humans who's world wasn't capable of supporting these giants?

##### Non-Fiction
- **Chaos: Making a New Science** by James Gleick

- **Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World** by David Epstein
