	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	<p>I will be starting a blog, where I will try and explain Machine Learning algorithms, from SVMs to CNNs to RNNs (and more)! This blog will be written as a means for active learning. If Iâ€™m lucky, it will help someone who is just starting out!</p>
	<p>Although the content here will be accurate to the best of my knowledge, it is possible that there may be some mistakes. If so, do point them out!</p>
	<p>Stay tuned!</p>
