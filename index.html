		<p>I am a first year Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, working on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My research interest lies in Continual Learning, with broader interest in efficient and robust learning for visual tasks.</p>

		<p>Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked with the <a href="https://precisionsustainableag.org/">Precision Sustainable Agriculture</a> initiative at NC State to build Computer Vision and Software solutions for problems in agriculture.</p>

		<p>I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Persistent Systems before coming back to academia. At Persistent, I worked on Deep Learning for Medical Imaging and large scale document recognition. I also spent some time developing internal SDKs for the Data Science team, and setting up MLOps frameworks.</p>
		
		<p>Outside of research, I like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57336050-chinmay-savadikar" title="Goodreads">reading</a> fiction and non-fiction. I also enjoy playing Football, listening to Oldies Rock Music, and watching sitcoms. </p>
