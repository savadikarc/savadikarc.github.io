		<p>I am a Master's student at North Carolina State University. I am broadly interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>

		<p>Prior to joining NC State, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Persistent Systems, where I worked on Deep Learning for Medical Imaging. I also spent some time developing internal SDKs for the Data Science team, and setting up MLOps frameworks.</p>
		
		<p>I graduated from University of Pune with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering, where I split my time between the Robotics and the Football (I refuse to call it Soccer) teams.</p>
		
		<p>I like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57336050-chinmay-savadikar" title="Goodreads">reading</a> fiction and non-fiction. I also enjoy playing Football, listening to Oldies Rock Music, and watching an occasional sitcom. </p>
