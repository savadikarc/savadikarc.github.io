		<p>I am a Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in Computer Vision. I like to develop robust, end-to-end Computer Vision solutions using both, Deep Learning and traditional Computer Vision algorithms.</p>

		<p>I have extensive experience with problems in Image Recognition, Object Detection, and Semantic Segmentation, and like to work on the full stack of Machine Learning and 
		Deep Learning pipeline - Data Visualization, Data Annotation, incremental training and fine-tuning of models, and deployment.</p>
		
		<p>I graduated from Savitribai Phule Pune University (you may know it as University of Pune) with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering.</p>
		
		<p>On the non-technical side, I like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57336050-chinmay-savadikar" title="Goodreads">reading</a> fiction and non-fiction. I enjoy playing Football, listening to Oldies Rock Music, and watching an occasional sitcom. </p>
