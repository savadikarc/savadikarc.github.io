	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	<p>On this blog, I will post content about Machine Learning (algorithms and theory). This blog will be written as a means for active learning. If Iâ€™m lucky, it will help someone who is just starting out! The content might be biased towards Computer Vision, since this is the area I have worked with the most. But as the blog progresses, I will broaden its scope.</p>
	<p>Although the content here will be accurate to the best of my knowledge, it is possible that there may be some mistakes. If so, do point them out!</p>
	<p>NOTE: I have yet to embedd a comments section, but will get around to it soon.</p>
	<ul class="posts">
		{% for post in site.posts %}
      		<li>
        		<span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
        		<a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        		<br>
      		</li>
