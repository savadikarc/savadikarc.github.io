		<p>I am a first year Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University. My research interest lies in Continual Learning, with broader interest in efficient and robust learning for visual tasks.</p>

		<p>I am also interested in applied research and software engineering, and worked with the <a href="https://precisionsustainableag.org/">Precision Sustainable Agriculture</a> initiative at NC State prior to starting my Ph.D. to build Computer Vision and Software solutions for problems in agriculture.</p>

		<p>Prior to joining NC State, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Persistent Systems, where I worked on Deep Learning for Medical Imaging. I also spent some time developing internal SDKs for the Data Science team, and setting up MLOps frameworks.</p>
		
		<p>Outside of research, I like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57336050-chinmay-savadikar" title="Goodreads">reading</a> fiction and non-fiction. I also enjoy playing Football, listening to Oldies Rock Music, and watching sitcoms. </p>
