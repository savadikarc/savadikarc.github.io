		<p>I am a Master's student at North Carolina State University, specializing in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.</p>

		<p>Prior to joining NC State, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Persistent Systems. I worked on training Deep Learning models, developing SDKs for the Data Science team, and setting up MLOps frameworks.</p>
		
		<p>I have worked on problems in Image Recognition, Object Detection, and Semantic Segmentation, and like to work on the full stack of Machine Learning and 
		Deep Learning pipeline - Data Visualization, Data Annotation, incremental training and fine-tuning of models, and deployment.</p>
		
		<p>I graduated from Savitribai Phule Pune University (you may know it as University of Pune) with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering, where I split my time between the Robotics and the Football (Soccer) teams.</p>
		
		<p>I like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57336050-chinmay-savadikar" title="Goodreads">reading</a> fiction and non-fiction. I also enjoy playing Football, listening to Oldies Rock Music, and watching an occasional sitcom. </p>
