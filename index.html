	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	<p>I am writing this blog as a means for active learning. It's content will be whatever I am studying at that time.</p>
	<p>Although the content here will be accurate to the best of my knowledge, it is possible that there may be some mistakes. 
		If so, do point them out! There is also a selfish interest for me, I get free reviews and corrections!</p>
