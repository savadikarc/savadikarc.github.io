			<p>I am writing this blog as a means for active learning. It's content will be whatever I am studying at that particular time.</p>
			<p>Although the content here will be accurate to the best of my knowledge, it is possible that there may be some mistakes. 
				If so, do point them out! As a selfish interest, I hope to get some free reviews and corrections on my posts!</p>
