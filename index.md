## Hi There!

I will be starting a blog, where I will try and explain Machine Learning algorithms, from SVMs to CNNs to RNNs (and more)! This blog will be written as a means for active learning. If I'm lucky, it will help someone who is just starting out!

Although the content here will be accurate to the best of my knowledge, it is possible that there may be some mistakes. If so, do point them out!

Stay tuned!
